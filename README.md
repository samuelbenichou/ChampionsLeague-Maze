## Genral info
The **Champions League Maze** is a game in which the purpose of the game is for the player to make their way from the start point to the end point.
The layout of the maze is such that the player must follow a series of narrow winding corridors with many false turns and dead-ends until they eventually reach the finish point.
We implemented many programming principles such as design patterns, multiThreading programming, Server/Client, Gui and JavaFX and SOLID coding guidelines.
We also practice use with Maven repositories manager include log4j2 LogManager.

### Maze Creation Algorithm
To create the mazes, I used the Prim algorithm, this algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

### Maze Solver Algorithm
To solve the mazes, I implemented 3 algorithms :
- Breadth-first search (BFS) which is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- Depth-first search (DFS) which is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
- Best-first search which is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.

### Design Pattern 
- Strategy pattern which is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- Observer pattern which is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
